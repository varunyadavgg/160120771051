## Code Documentation

This code is a simple Flask application that exposes an API endpoint `/numbers` to fetch numbers from multiple URLs and return a sorted list of unique numbers as a JSON response.

### Dependencies

The code requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- `requests`: A library for making HTTP requests.
- `Flask`: A micro web framework for building web applications in Python.

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install requests Flask
```

### Code Explanation

1. Importing the required modules:

```python
import requests
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
```

2. Creating a Flask application instance:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

3. Defining a function to fetch numbers from a given URL:

```python
def fetch_numbers_from_url(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=0.5)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            numbers = data.get("numbers", [])
            return numbers
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        pass  # Ignore URLs that take too long to respond or timeout
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching data from {url}: {e}")
    return []
```

4. Defining a route `/numbers` and its corresponding handler function:

```python
@app.route("/numbers", methods=["GET"])
def get_numbers():
    urls = request.args.getlist("url")
    unique_numbers = set()

    for url in urls:
        numbers = fetch_numbers_from_url(url)
        unique_numbers.update(numbers)

    sorted_numbers = sorted(unique_numbers)

    return jsonify({"numbers": sorted_numbers})
```

5. Starting the Flask application:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8008)
```

### Usage

1. Start the Flask application by running the script.
2. Send a GET request to `http://localhost:8008/numbers` with one or more query parameters `url` containing the URLs from which you want to fetch numbers.
3. The API will fetch numbers from the provided URLs, remove duplicates, sort them, and return a JSON response containing the sorted numbers.

Note: Make sure to replace `localhost` with the appropriate hostname or IP address if running the code on a remote server.

That's it! This code provides a basic example of how to create a Flask API endpoint to fetch and process data from multiple URLs.
